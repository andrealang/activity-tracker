# Managing users and permissions
{: #iam_users_events}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that are organized in a resource group in your account are managed by using {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM). You can monitor IAM actions in your account with the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service.
{:shortdesc}

Account owners are automatically assigned the account administrator role for IAM. As the account administrator, you can assign and manage access for users, create resource groups, create access groups, view billing details and track usage, and create service instances. You provide access for users, service IDs, and access groups by creating policies that set a target for the subject of the policy to access and a role that defines what type of access that is allowed. [Learn more](/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles).


## Events that are generated when you invite a user to your account
{: #iam_users_events_1}


### Invite a user to the account
{: #iam_users_events_1_1}

When you invite a user to your account, you get an event from the platform service **BSS** and action **user-management.user.create**.

```
8/Nov/2019:15:49:41 BSS User management service: create user
```
{: screen}

The field **target.name** includes information about the user that is being added.

### Invite a user to the account and add to one or more access groups
{: #iam_users_events_1_2}

When you invite a user, as part of the same request, you can also add this user to 1 or more access groups in your account. For each access group that you select, you get an event from the platform service **iam-groups** with action **iam-groups.member.add**.

```
8/Nov/2019:15:49:42 iam-groups IAM Access Groups: add member <Access group name>  
```
{: screen}

The field **requestData.iam_id** includes information about the user that is being added.

The field **target.name** includes information about the access group to which the user is added.

The **initiator** fields are set to an IBM owned service ID that is used to complete the clean process of the user in the account as a result of the action *user-management.user.add*.

### Invite a user to the account and assign additional access
{: #iam_users_events_1_3}

When you invite a user, you can also assign additional access to the following type of resources:

* *Cloud Foundry* to grant access to orgs and spaces that contain resources managed by Cloud Foundry.

    ```

    4/Dec/2019:15:49:22 cloud-foundry audit.user.organization_auditor_add 
    4/Dec/2019:15:49:24 cloud-foundry audit.user.space_auditor_add 
    ```
    {: screen}

* *Classic infrastructure* to grant access for classic infrastructure resources.

    ```
    ```
    {: screen}

* *IAM services* to grant access to IAM-enabled services.
 
    ```
    4/Dec/2019:15:49:44 iam-am IAM Access Management: create policy   
    ```
    {: screen}

* *Account management* to grant access to services like billing, user management, support center, and more.

    ```
    4/Dec/2019:15:49:44 iam-am IAM Access Management: create policy  
    ```
    {: screen}


## Events that are generated when you remove a user from the account
{: #iam_users_events_1}

When you remove a user from your account, an event from the platform service *BSS* with action **user-management.user.delete** is generated.

    ```
    4/Dec/2019:19:22:31 BSS User management service: delete user  
    ```
    {: screen}

* If the user belongs to 1 or more access groups, you get an event from each access group from which the user is removed. These events are generated by the platform service **iam-groups** with action **iam-groups.member.delete**.

    ```
    4/Dec/2019:19:22:32 iam-groups IAM Access Groups: delete members 
    ```
    {: screen}

    The field **responseData.member_id** includes information about the user that is being removed.

    The field **target.id** includes information about the access group from which the user is removed.

    The **initiator** fields are set to an IBM owned service ID that is used to complete the clean process of the user in the account as a result of the action *user-management.user.delete*.

* If
