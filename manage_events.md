# Managing events in your account
{: #manage_events}

After you provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can monitor events through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI.

## Export events

You can export data in JSONL format from an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance into a local file. You can export logs programmatically by using the LogDNA REST API.

Consider the following information when you export log data:
* You export a set of event entries. To define the set of data that you want to export, you can apply filter and searches. You can also specify the time range. 
* From the web UI, when you export events, you get an email that is sent to your email address, with a link to a compressed file that includes the data. To get the data, you must click the link and download the compressed file.
* When you export events programmatically, you can choose to send an email or to stream events in to your terminal.
* The compressed file that contains the data that you want to export is available for a maximum of 48 hours. 
* The maximum number of lines that you can export is 10,000.
