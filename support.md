# Support Cases
{: #support_cases}

This page tells how your service can get support from LogDNA for a problem with *Log Analysis with LogDNA* or *Activity Tracker with LogDNA*. Support is provided via IBM Cloud Support. To get started, open a case by following the steps below. 

Support is supplemented by the Slack channel *ibm-guest-logdna-help*. However, incidents should be reported by opening cases.

## To open a case on LogDNA
{: #open_case}

1. Log into the IBM Cloud account your team uses.
1. On the IBM Cloud console, click "Support" at the top.
1. Click "Create a case" on the right.
1. Select "Technical".
1. Category: select "Developer Tools and Runtimes."
1. Offering: usually have to leave it blank. You are usually using a different account for support than where the LogDNA instance is.
1. Severity: Select the appropriate Severity. 
  - If you do not see a place to set the Severity, then you do not have Advanced or Premium support. Your cases will have severity 4 only. See the section below.
  - If your team does have Adv/Prem support, then consider whether you are logged into the right account for it. See the section below.
1. Subject: Mention "LogDNA" in the subject. This is important, so the support team will quickly see they need to route the case to LogDNA.
1. Fill out the rest of the form. Include this information:
  - Account Information, Environment, Region (URL included)<br>- You can get this by copying the URL from the LogDNA UI.<br>- Response to tickets is often delayed because this vital information is missing.
  - Problem statement (Expected behavior)
  - Result of the problem (Actual behavior)
  - Any configuration information inclusive of that problem (Patterns, how to replicate issue)
  - Known changes that occurred on the client-side since the problem started
  - Any other information (please include screenshots, video)
1. Submit.

## Advanced/Premium Support
{: #adv-prem}

Your service must have *Advanced Support* or *Premium Support* to open cases with severity of 1, 2, or 3, or to escalate cases. If you only have *Basic Support* (the free level), then you can only open cases with severity 4. See [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-plans) for an explanation of support levels.Â 

#### To see if you have Advanced Support:

1. Log into your service's account in the IBM Cloud. 
	- Typically your service will have one IBM Cloud account designated for Advanced Support, and the team members will use that account for opening cases.
	- It must be an internal paid account.
2. Click "Support" at the top.
3. On the right, the "Plan" section will show your support plan. If it is "basic" support, you need to upgrade to at least "advanced."


If you do not have Advanced (or Premium) support, see [here](https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/cldsup-internal) for instructions on how to order it.
