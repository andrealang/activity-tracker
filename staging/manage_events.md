# Managing events
{: #manage_events.md}

After you provision an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can view, monitor, and manage events through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI.
{:shortdesc}

When you launch the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI, events are displayed with a predefined format. You can modify in the **User Preferences** section how the information in each record is displayed. You can also filter events and modify search settings, then bookmark the result as a *view*. You can attach and detach one or more alerts to a view. You can define a custom format for how your lines are shown in the view. You can expand a log line and see the data parsed.
