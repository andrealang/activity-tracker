# Managing alerts
{: #alerts}

Through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI, you can apply search queries to define the events that are displayed through a custom view. Then, you can attach an alert to that view to be notified when a condition occurs. You can attach one or more alerts to a view. You can define multiple notification channels for an alert. You can mute alerts. You can detach alerts from a view.

## Configure an alert
{: alerts_config}

### Prerequisites
{: #alerts_prereqs}

* [Learn more about alerts](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-monitor_events#mon_alerts).

* **You must have a paid service plan** for the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service. [Learn more](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-service_plan#service_plan).

* Check that your user ID has permissions to launch the web UI and view events. The following table lists the minimum roles that a user must have to be able to launch the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI, and view, search, and filter events:

| Role                      | Permission granted            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Platform role: `Viewer`     | Allows the user to view the list of service instances in the Observability dashboard. |
| Service role: `Reader`      | Allows the user to launch the web UI and view events in the web UI.  |

### Step 2. Create a view
{: #alerts_step2}

[Create a view](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-views).

After you configure an alert on a view and receive a notification email from `LogDNA Alerts`, complete the following steps to mute the alert a period of time:

1. Go to the email account where you receive email notifications.

2. Open a notification email for a view that you want to mute. 

    Look for emails that are sent by `LogDNA Alerts`. The subject includes the name of the view.

    In the email, there is a section that includes the following text: 

    ```
     Mute these alerts for   [1 Hour] [6 Hours] [12 Hours] [1 Day]
    ```
    {: screen}

3. Choose a period of time.

    A window opens. The information provided indicates the view, the notification that is muted, and the time period that is muted for.

    For example, you can get a message that indicates the following:

    ```
    Email alerting for MyView has been muted for an hour.

    Unmute

    Alerting is scheduled to resume at Jun 14, 11:59am.
