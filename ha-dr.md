_* The automatic HA and DR capabilities that your offering provides, for example, global load balancing, multi-availability zones, data replication or data mirroring, active-active or active-passive clusters_

_* If applicable, the supported tools that your offering provides to help users create their own HA and DR capabilities_

_* Application deployment considerations_

## Using the standard template
{: #hadr-standard}

_If your offering complies with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} standards of availability, use the standard template that we provide. See the following example._
