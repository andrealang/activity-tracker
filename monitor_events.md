# Monitoring activity in your account
{: #monitor_events}

You can monitor activity in your account through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI. You can also export sets of events to analyze them in a different context.
{:shortdesc}

There is 1 instance of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service per location. Therefore, to monitor activity in your account, you might need to view and analyze events through different {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instances. 

In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > **Observability** > **Activity Tracker** to see the dashboard where all the instances that are provisioned in the account are listed. 
{: tip}

To view events, first, you must [launch the web UI](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch) in the location where events are available. Then, you can work with views to monitor those events. You view events in your local time.

You can select the events that are displayed through a view by applying a timestamp, a search query, or both.

* You can apply a search query, and save it as a custom view. 
* You can apply a timestamp to jump to a specific time in your event log. 

When you apply a search query, you can save that view for reuse later. However, timestamps are not saved.

Notice that instances might have different service plans, and consequently different data retention periods that determine the number of days that you have data available for search though the web UI. You can only monitor events within your retention period. Different [service plans](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-service_plan) have different retention periods.


## Monitoring global and location-based events
{: #mon_def_event_type}

Events can be classified as global or location-based. The type of event determines where you must monitor events.

The common theme for global events is a single, synchronized location where account administrators can monitor certain types of activity across the Cloud. Meanwhile, location-based events remain local to the location where a subscribed cloud service is hosted.
{: note}

### Global events
{: #mon_def_global}

**Global events** report on activity in your account that relate to data and resources that are generally synchronized across all regions.
{: note}

The services that users interact with are integrated into the core of the global {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} experience.

The global domain is set in **Frankfurt**. Global events are captured and made available through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance that is configured in Frankfurt.

For example, when an account administrator invites users to join the account, they can do it from any location in the Cloud. They might invite a user that is located in Frankfurt and grant them permissions to work with a service that is provisioned in Dallas. Where should the event go? The answer is a global domain that is agnostic of origin or location, and where the information is synchronized across all regions.
    
Another example, resource controller events are also considered global events in IBM Cloud. These events report provisioning and deletion of service instances across the Cloud. Although a service instance is created in a specific location, resource controller actions are reported as global events to offer a single view of all the service instances that are provisioned across the account.


### Location-based events
{: #mon_def_location}

**Location-based events** report on activity in your account that is generated by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services that are hosted within an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} data center location, like Dallas or Frankfurt. 
{: note}


When clients and applications interact with cloud services hosted within a location, location-based events are captured and made available through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance that is configured in that location. You view these events by [launching the web UI](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch) in that location.
    
Location-based events maintain data locality to the services that run in that Cloud location.

For example, if you provision the {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}} service in the Frankfurt location, events from that instance will be sent to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance that is provisioned in Frankfurt. If you provision the {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}} service in the Dallas location, events from that instance will be sent to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance that is provisioned in Dallas. In both cases, events are kept local to the region and location of the subscribed Cloud Service.




## Monitoring events through the default view
{: #mon_def_view}

The default view is named **Everything**. 

As soon as you open the web UI in a location, this is the view that you see. 

All events in your instance are displayed through this view.

To learn how to view events through this view, see [Viewing events](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-view_events#view_events_step1).

## Monitoring events through custom views
{: #mon_cus_view}

You might want to monitor a set of events in your account. To anayze a subset of events, you can create custom views. 

To create a custom view, you must apply a search query that defines what events to display through the view. [Learn more](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-view_events#view_events_step2).

You can [attach alerts](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-alerts) to a custom view. 

You can [export data](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-export) from a custom view. 

You can [rename, and add or modify the description of a view](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-views#views_step5). 

You can [apply a line template](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-views#views_step4) to a view to customize how the data is displayed. 

You can organize views by grouping them in **categories*.


## Monitoring events by applying a timeframe
{: #mon_time_view}

You might want to see events within a specific timeframe.

You can select the events that are displayed through a view by [applying a timeframe](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-view_events#view_events_step3).

You can apply a timestamp by specifying an absolute time, a relative time, or a time range.

* An abosute time specifies a precise point in time in your event log, such as `May 20 7:00pm`.
    
* A relative time specifies a timeframe that is not precise, such as `2 days ago`.

* A time range specified an interval of time, such as `yesterday 10am to yesterday 11am`.



## Configuring alerts
{: #mon_alerts}

There are scenarios where you might want to be notified if specific events are generated in your account. For example, you might want to be notified if the number of actions that fail goes above a threshold that you specify. 

Through the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI, you can apply search queries to define the events that are displayed through a custom view. Then, you can attach an alert to that view to be notified when a condition occurs. A bell icon is displayed with the view to indicate that this view has an alert attached to it.

* You can [attach one alert](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-alerts#alerts_step4) per view.
* You can configure conditions that are based on the number of event lines that meet the search query in the view, on a time frequency, or both.
* You can define multiple notification channels for an alert. For information about the supported channels, see [Alert notification channels](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-channels).
* You can [define a **preset**](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-alerts#alerts_step3). A preset is an alert template that you can attach to any number of views. You can use presets to define templates that users can reuse when they attach an alert to a view. 
* You can mute alerts. 
* You can [detach an alert](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-alerts#alerts_delete_view) from a view. 


### Alert types
{: #mon_alerts_types}

You can configure the following types of alerts:

* **Presence alert**: You can use this type of alert to notify when the number of events that show in a view is more than what you expect. 
* **Absence alert**: You can use this type of alert to notify when the number of events that show in a view is less than what you expect, or none. 

For example, you might have a view that shows events that report the deletion of service instances in your account. You are not expecting the deletion of service instances. You can configure a *presence alert** that triggers an alert when 1 or more events show in the view.

The absence alert is enabled after an event is shown in the view.
{: note}


### Alert conditions
{: #mon_alerts_conditions}

You can configure any of the following conditions for an alert:

* **Time frequency**: You set this condition to specify how often to trigger an alert. Valid values are: 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours
* **Event lines counter**: You set this condition to specify the number of event lines that match the view's filtering and search criteria. When the number of event lines is reached, an alert is triggered.

You can decide whether both conditions are checked or only one. If both conditions are set, an alert is triggered when any of the thresholds is reached. 

If you set the *Event lines counter* to be the only condition that triggers an alert, notice that the time frequency that is set when you configure the condition determines the time that it takes for the alert condition to be reset after the alert is triggered.
{: note}

For example, you can configure an alert that is triggered after 30 seconds, or when a 100 event lines that match the view's filtering and search criteria are collected.



## Exporting events
{: #mon_export}

You might need access to a set of events outside the web UI to investigate an issue in more detail. 

You can export data in JSONL format from an {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance into a local file. 

You can export events through a view in the web UI, or programmatically by using a REST API.

Consider the following information when you export events:
* You export a set of event entries. 
* To define the set of data that you want to export, you can apply filter and searches. You can also specify the time range. 
* The maximum number of lines that you can export is 20,000.

### By using the REST API
{: #mon_export_api}

You can export events programmatically by using the LogDNA REST API. [Learn more](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-export#export_api).

When you export events programmatically, consider the following information:

* You can choose to send an email or to stream events in to your terminal.
* You must use a service key that is used to pass the credentials that must be used when you make an export REST API call. 

    You must have **manager** role for the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance or service to view and generate service keys in the web UI.


### Through a view in the web UI
{: #mon_export_ui}

You can export events through a view in the web UI. 

In the web UI, you can select a view that displays the data that you want to export. For this view, you must choose the task to **Export Lines**. You must specify a time range, and whether to export newer lines or older lines. Then, you can request the export. 

After you submit a request, you get an email that is sent to your email address, with a link to a compressed file that includes the data. 
* To get the data, you must click the link and download the compressed file. 
* The compressed file that contains the data that you want to export is available for a maximum of 48 hours.
