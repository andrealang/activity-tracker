# Event fields
{: #event}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} events are based on the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. 
{:shortdesc}

The CADF standard defines a full event model that includes the information that is needed to certify, manage, and audit security of applications in cloud environments.

The CADF event model includes the following components:

| Component | Description |
|------------|----------------------------|
| `Action`   | The action is the operation or activity that an initiator performs, attempts to perform, or is waiting to complete. |
| `Initiator`| The initiator is the resource that makes an API call and generates a CADF event. The event that is triggered depends on the action that is requested by the API call. |
| `Observer` | The observer is the resource that creates and stores a CADF record from information available in a CADF event. |
| `Outcome`  | The outcome is the status of the action against the target. |
| `Target`   | The target is the resource against which the action is performed, attempted to perform, or is pending to complete. |
{: caption="Table 1. Components that are available in a CADF event model" caption-side="top"} 


The following fields are included in each Activity Tracker event:


## action (string)
{: #action_field}

This field indicates the action that triggers an event. 
{: note}

The format of this field is the following:

```
serviceName.objectType.action
```
{: codeblock}

Where 

* `servicename` is the name of the service.

    There is an exception on the `servicename` that is set for actions reported by the VPC infrastructure. The format of the `servicename` is composed of 2 parts that are separated by a dot `.`.

* `objectType` describes the resource or resource attribute on which the action is requested. 

* `action` defines the task requested by the initiator.  

    Some valid actions are: `add`, `bulkdelete`, `create`, `read`, `update`,`delete`, `backup`, `build`, `capture`, `configure`, `deploy`, `disable`, `enable`, `get`, `import`, `inspect`, `list`, `monitor`, `pull`, `push`, `restore`, `start`, `stop`, `undeploy`, `receive`, `reimport`, `remove`, `send`, `set`, `set-on`, `set-off`, `authenticate`, `read`, `renew`, `revoke`, `allow`, `deny`, `evaluate`, `notify`, `rotate`

For more information about action values that are generated by services, see [Cloud services](/docs/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA-cloud_services#cloud_services).

For example, a sample action is `iam-am.policy.create`.


## eventTime (string)
{: #eventTime_field}

This field indicates the timestamp when the event was created. 
{: note}

The timestamp that you see for an event in the LogDNA web UI is set from eventTime and indicates the time when the event was created.
{: important}
  
The date is represented as Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). 

The format of this field is: 

```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SS+0000
```
{: codeblock}
   
For example, a sample eventTime is `2017-10-19T19:07:50.32+0000`.



## Initiator fields
{: #initiator}

Initiator fields provide information about the user, service, or application that request to run an action in your account.
